        have a background in the sciences having earned a bachelors degree in
        Microbiology in 2015. I joined a mid-tier FMCG firm a month after
        mandatory youth service and spent two years from Jan 2017 to Jan 2019
        as the principal logistics officer essentially coordinating all
        transfers of inventory nationwide.
        I left my position at
        the firm to pursue a career in tech which is something I have always wanted to do.<br></br>
        <br></br> My quest to learn web development the right way has exposed me to
        some of the best resources and tutors available on the web. I talk in
        detail about my motivations and journey{" "} */}
        I switched careers in 2019 from my former position as the principal logistics officer at
        a mid-tier FMCG firm to tech. <br></br>A couple months into my first official frontend role and 
        I couldn't be more pleased with how everything's worked out so far. <br></br>
        I completed my first major solo project a couple months ago
         - a fully featured agent web application with React. 
        I talk in great detail about switching
